            <p><i>reputation</i> came after a time of darkness and silence. In 2016, Kanye West released a song called
                "Famous" wherein he asserts he made "that bitch" (Taylor) "famous", in reference to the infamous 2009
                award speech interruption. Taylor responded to this lyric, tweeting that despite knowing about the song,
                she never knew about the lyric calling her "that bitch".

            <p>Fast forward to June, and Kim Kardashian released a snippet of the phone call between Taylor and Kanye,
                making it seem like Taylor <i>did</i> approve the lyric. Taylor asserted that she didn't approve that
                specific lyric, but nonetheless, she was fully cancelled, even at the height of <i>1989's</i> success.

            <p>Taylor's instagram was filled with snake emojis, #TaylorSwiftIsOverParty, and generally distateful
                comments. She then erased her presence from social media, and withdrew from the public eye completely.
                She states in her documentary, "Miss Americana", "nobody physically saw me for a year."

            <p>To make things worse, in July of 2016, Kanye released a music video for "Famous" where there is a shot of
                him in bed with a naked Taylor Swift wax figure.

            <p>Overall, 2016 was a rough time for Taylor. Her ex, Calvin Harris, released a song she wrote ("This Is
                What You Came For"), and denied claims that she wrote or sang backup for the song, until her publicist
                confirmed it was her and he had to backpedal, admitting it was Taylor's song and also tweeting vaguely
                rude things about her.

            <p>Even those closest to her betrayed her online. The man who would eventually buy her masters, Scooter
                Braun, took to instagram to bully her in conjunction with Justin Bieber and Kanye West. Her best friend,
                Karlie Kloss, refused to defend her in an article, even saying "Kim is a really lovely person." Karlie
                later signed to be managed by Scooter Braun.

            <p>Despite the hardships and betrayals of 2016, Taylor also met her current partner, Joe Alwyn, and that
                blooming relationship is reflected well in <i>reputation</i>. On the outside, <i>reputation</i> is dark,
                angry, and vengeful, but deeper into the tracklist, we see that it is actually a very romantic album.

            <p>The lead single, "Look What You Made Me Do", is a bit cringey but ultimately an excellent choice to open
                the reputation era. It signals her rebirth: <i>"The old Taylor can't come to the phone right now. Why?
                    Oh, 'cause she's dead!"</i>

            <p>Yet, there are songs like "Gorgeous" and "Delicate" that go into the intimate details of a new and, well,
                delicate, relationship that Taylor has found in her darkest times. In "Dress" she sings: <i>Even in my
                    worst times, you could see the best of me</i>.
