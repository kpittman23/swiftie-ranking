            <p><i>Speak Now</i> is an incredibly petty response to misogynistic critics who said Taylor didn't "pull her
                weight" in the writing sessions for <i>Taylor Swift</i> and <i>Fearless</i>. <i>Speak Now</i> is
                entirely and solely written by Taylor.

            <p><i>Speak Now</i> delves into some new musical styles, including pop-rock and whatever "arena-rock" is.

            <p>Taylor has described <i>Speak Now</i> as a loose concept album about the things she never had a chance to
                say. The title track, "Speak Now" has the narrator interrupting a wedding, where "Back To December"
                delivers a heartfelt apology to an old lover. "Dear John" and "Better Than Revenge" are less apologetic,
                more scathing.

            <p>Despite "Mean" winning a grammy for Best Country Song, <i>Speak Now</i> is Taylor's worst performing
                album in terms of awards and accolades. It was generally well received by the public and music experts,
                but it was also criticized for not being sonically cohesive.

            <p>The chaos of the album extended to Taylor's second arena tour. <i>The Speak Now World Tour</i> was the
                most extra tour of Taylor's career, and included a full wedding set, Taylor throwing a chair off a
                platform, and the iconic "Haunted" bell.

            <p>Despite it's criticisms, <i>Speak Now</i> was an important step in Taylor's career, especially in regards
                to her willingness to experiment with different sounds and step out of the country box.
