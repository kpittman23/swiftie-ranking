            <p><i>folklore</i>, Taylor's first surprise album, was released at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic
                during the time when she would have been performing her sixth concert tour, Loverfest.

            <p> For the first time in her career, Taylor was inspired by fiction. During quarantine, she gave herself
                permission to "make music without any rules", and so <i>folklore</i> was born, and then 5 months later,
                her sister album, <i>evermore</i>.

            <p><i>folklore</i> was recorded entirely from Taylor's home, in a makeshift studio she named Kitty
                Committee. Her collaborators, Jack Antonoff, Aaron Dessner (of The National), and Justin Vernon (of Bon
                Iver) worked on the album virutally.

            <p>Taylor only had one in-person collaborator for <i>folklore</i>, her long time boyfriend Joe Alwyn, who is
                credited under a pseudonym: William Bowery, and actually earned a grammy for his involvement.

            <p><i>folklore</i> explores ideas and imagery that Taylor had not previously explored in her music. The
                album is wistful, nostalgic, and mournful, a major departure from her previous 3.5 80s synth pop albums.
                It isn't too far, however, from her country music roots. In the Disney+ Long Pond sessions, Taylor talks
                about how she was inspired by old country music, specifically in "The Last Great American Dynasty" which
                uses an old country narrative device of inserting the narrator in the story via a twist at the end.

            <p>"Betty" is another track that has heavy country music influence, featuring a harmonica and Taylor's old
                fake twangy accent. "Betty" is also part of a musical love triangle between "Betty", "Cardigan", and
                "August", which describes the same event from three different perspectives at three different times in
                their lives.

            <p>Coming as a shock to absolutely no one, <i>folklore</i> won a Grammy for Album of the Year at the 2021
                Grammy awards, following an incredible run of broken records. It broke the record for most opening-day
                streams for a female artist, a record which would again be broken by Rad (Taylor's Version).
                <i>folklore</i> became Taylor's seventh consecutive #1 album, making her the fourth woman to ever score
                seven #1 albums, joining the likes of Barbra Streisand, Madonna, and Janet Jackson.

            <p>Taylor's surprise drop of <i>folklore</i> cemented her spot as one of the songwriting greats, and answers
                the frequently asked but incredibly shallow question, "what will you do when you can't write break up
                songs anymore?"
