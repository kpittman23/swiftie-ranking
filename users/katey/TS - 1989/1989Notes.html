            <p>1989 is an anthology on how Harry Styles should not have a driver's license. Much of 1989 is about Harry,
                just as many of the lyrics about him are about how he is a horrible driver.

            <p>"Style" opens with <i>Midnight, come and pick me up no headlights/Long drive, could end in buring flames
                    or paridise</i>. The driving slander continues in the second verse where she sings <i>So it goes, he
                    can't keep his wild eyes on the road</i>

            <p>Sure, it's a metaphor for their short and tumultuous relationship, but could it be more?
                Could Taylor and Harry have committed vehicular manslaughter together?

            <p>In the fourth track, "Out of the Woods", the bridge describes an accident Taylor and Harry
                had in 2012. <i>Remember when you hit the brakes too soon? Twenty stitches in a hospital
                    room</i>

            <p>There are more Harry driving references in "Wonderland": <i>Flashing lights and we took a
                    wrong turn</i> and again in "All You Had To Do Was Stay": <i>All I know is that you
                    drove us off the road</i>

            <p>Suffice to say, they should probably both stay out of the drivers seat.

            <p>Harry Styles aside, 1989, Taylor's most award winning and record breaking album, was born
                out of a gut wrenching loss. Her 4th studio album, Red, lost to Daft Punk's "Random Access
                Memories" for Album of the Year at the 2014 Grammy's. During the 2015 GrammyPro listening
                sessions, Taylor talks about the inspiration for 1989. She says after her loss at the
                Grammy's, she woke up at 4 in the morning and she just knew: "it's called 1989, its 80s
                synth pop, I'm calling it a pop record, I'm not listening to anyone at my record label, and
                I'm starting tomorrow."

            <p>Much of 1989 is a response to the way Taylor was treated by the media during the Red era. She
                was criticized for brandishing the intimate details of her past relationships, for being
                vindictive and clingy, and dating too much. During her acceptance speech for Woman of the
                Decade at the Billboard awards in 2019, she said :
            <p><i>"Now they're saying my album Red is filled with too many breakup songs? Okay, okay, I'll
                    make one about moving to New York and deciding that really my life is more fun with just
                    my friends. Oh, they're saying my music is changing too much for me to stay in country
                    music? All right. Okay, here's an entire genre shift and a pop album called 1989."</i>

            <p>1989 collected 3 Grammy Awards in 2016, including Album of the Year, Best Pop Vocal Album,
                and Best Music Video (Bad Blood). It had 3 number ones and 5 top tens.

            <p>Ultimately, 1989 was the album that transformed Taylor from a quirky country artist to a full
                blown international phenomenon.
