            <p><i>evermore</i> is a hard album to write about, simply because Taylor acts like it does not exist.

            <p>On December 11, 2020, only 5 months after the release of <i>folklore</i> Taylor surprise released
                <i>evermore</i> tweeting: "I'm elated to tell you that my 9th studio album, and folklore's sister
                record, will be out tonight at midnight eastern. It's called evermore." with a picture of the back of
                her head, and then literally never spoke of it again.

            <p><i>evermore</i> was literally nominated for Album of the Year at the Grammys, and Taylor didn't even show
                up.

            <p>In many ways, <i>evermore</i> is just an extension of <i>folklore</i>, perhaps even more like the "vault
                tracks" of the new Taylor's Versions of <i>Red</i> and <i>Fearless</i>. Because of this "vault track"
                feeling, <i>evermore</i> is a little bit less cohesive than <i>folklore</i>. Songs like "long story
                short" and "closure" stick out like sore thumbs in a list of folksy tracks.

            <p>And while most of the other tracks stick with the folksy theme, the stories aren't intertwined the way
                they were on <i>folklore</i>. There's no high school love triangle, though there are some similarities
                in the stories from "'tis the damn season" and "dorothea". There's also a bit more of a mystical, witchy
                theme amongst songs like "willow", "ivy", and even "right where you left me".

            <p><i>evermore</i> has far more influence from The National than it's sister, evident in songs like "'tis
                the Damn Season" and "coney Island" which Matt Beringer (of The National) even sings on. The composition
                of <i>evermore</i> feels more like it was made for a band rather than a solo performer, which likely
                comes from the fact that the first two songs written, "closure" and "dorothea" were written for Big Red
                Machine, a band made up of Aaron Dessner (The National) and Justin Vernon (Bon Iver) named after the
                1970s Cincinnati Reds.

            <p>Ultimately, <i>evermore</i>, the silent sister of beloved and award winning <i>folklore</i> probably
                deserves a little more hype than she gets. She's bold, she's playful, and even just a bit more free. And
                as many fans will tell you, even though <i>evermore</i> isn't as good of an album as <i>folklore</i>,
                she's got the better songs.
