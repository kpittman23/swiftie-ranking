            <p>Taylor dipped her toes into pop music with the making of <i>Red</i>, the first step in turning herself
                into an international pop icon.

            <p>She worked with Max Martin and Shellback on the main pop numbers on <i>Red</i>: "22", "I Knew You Were
                Trouble" and "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together". The album was still marketed as a country album,
                however, and was thus criticized for not being cohesive.

            <p>Taylor released <i>Red (Taylor's Version)</i> in November 2021, the second out of six re-recordings. It
                was released with 10 vault tracks, including some songs fans already knew, like "Ronan", a song from a
                cancer benefit, "Babe", originally sung by Sugarland, and "Better Man", originally sung by Little Big
                Town. The vault also includes a 10 minute version of All Too Well, which fans have been begging for ever
                since Taylor let it slip that there was a 10 minute version she hadn't released back in 2012.

            <p>Upon release, <i>Red (Taylor's Version)</i> had all 28 tracks chart on the Billboard Hot 100. "All Too
                Well (10 Minute Version)" hit #1 on the Hot 100 and became the longest #1 of all time, beating out
                "American Pie" by Don McLean.

            <p><i>Red (Taylor's Version)</i> was a major pop-culture moment. It's no longer cool to hate Taylor Swift,
                as seen by the amount of companies and influencers using Red TV content for marketing and branding. Red
                TV overcame the misogyny that ran rampant in 2012 during its original release: all comments about Taylor
                being a "boy crazy, vengeful ex" turned into comments about her "masterclass in pop songwriting and
                poetry." Oh how the turn tables.

            <p><i>Red</i> is clearly very close to Taylor's heart. <i>Red</i> reflects a difficult time emotionally for
                Taylor, even further revealed by the vault tracks on the re-release. During the Red era in 2012, Taylor
                would often get emotional while performing All Too Well, even crying on stage during the performance at
                the Grammys in 2014. Now, she often performs it with a smile, noting in an instagram post: "it always
                blows my mind that it is consistently one of the loudest songs the crowd sings when I play it".
