            <p><i>Lover</i> never got the full era it deserved, thanks to COVID-19. <i>Lover</i> was supposed to be a
                bright and airy awakening following the darker <i>reputation</i>, and it was, but only for a brief time
                before a virus shut the world down.

            <p><i>Lover</i> was the first album Taylor owned after leaving Big Machine Records and signing with
                Republic. She described it as "a love letter to love itself" and noted that it was the first time she
                got to write about "love that was very real."

            <p>She was set to perform a world tour in summer of 2020, but obviously that didn't happen. Instead, Taylor
                released <i>folklore</i> and <i>evermore</i>, launching us all into a cottage-core era.

            <p><i>Lover</i> has a few quirks, including the most chaotic run in Taylor's discography: "London Boy",
                "Soon You'll Get Better", and "False God", AKA "Corny Things About London", "My Mom Has Cancer", and
                "SEX". <i>Lover</i> also includes one of the most hated songs amongst fans: "ME!".

            <p>Despite being an actual banger, fans and critics alike <i>hate</i> "ME!". Sure, the addition (and
                ultimate removal) of "Hey kids, spelling is fun!" is hard to listen to, but "ME!" is actually the
                perfect choice for the lead single for <i>Lover</i>.

            <p>The stark transition from <i>reputation</i> to <i>Lover</i> is important. Taylor tells us:
                <i>reputation</i> was a persona. <i>Lover</i> is "ME!".
