            <p><i>Fearless</i> was the album that shot Taylor to the top of the country charts and made her a mainstream
                musician. It spent 11 weeks at #1 on Billboard 200, and still holds the record for most weeks at #1 for
                a female country album.

            <p>"Love Story" was an international hit, "You Belong With Me" is still one of her most iconic music videos,
                and "Change" was even included as one of the theme songs for the 2008 Summer Olympics.

            <p>Despite being an international success, Taylor was of course subject to misogynistic critical analysis.
                There was plenty of criticism about her singing ability, as well as accusations of her "not pulling her
                weight in the writers room", even though she is a writer on every single track, inlcuding 5 tracks she
                wrote solo.

            <p>Nonetheless, <i>Fearless</i> won Album of the Year at the 2010 Grammys. In fact, Taylor won 4 different
                Grammys for <i>Fearless</i>, making her the youngest solo AOTY recipient ever (until Billie Eilish won in 2019). <i>Fearless</i> is also
                the most awarded album in the history of country music, even to this day.

            <p>Even more, <i>Fearless</i> is one of the best selling country albums of all time, only behind
                like 12 different Garth Brooks albums, 1 Shania Twain Album, and 1 Dixie Chicks album.

            <p>Taylor clearly made her mark on country music with <i>Fearless</i>, though, interestingly, it is
                probably her least talked about album amongst swifties. Most swfities love "Pop Taylor", and the
                ones who still love "Country Taylor" really just like <i>Speak Now</i>.

            <p>Even when <i>Fearless (Taylor's Version)</i> was released, it barely had time in the spotlight.
                Of course Taylor racked up her #1 hits and broke streaming records, but the Fearless TV era only
                existed from March through June 2021.

            <p><i>Fearless</i> is a solid, straightforward album. It doesn't come with a lot of baggage, and
                it's relatable to anyone who has ever been to high school or dealt with a stupid boy. It's
                youthful, romantic, and maybe even a little suburban.

            <p>There is something reminiscent, too, about Taylor's Version being released all these years later,
                when everyone is more grown up, specifically with songs like "Fifteen." Taylor herself was only
                19 when the original <i>Fearless</i> was released, and there is something so magical about
                hearing her sing, 13 years later at the age of 32: <i>I've found time can heal most anything/And
                    you just might found who you're supposed to be/I didn't know who I was supposed to be/At
                    15".</i>
