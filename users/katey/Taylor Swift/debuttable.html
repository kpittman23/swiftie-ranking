            <p>The story of Taylor Swift's self-titled debut album starts when she was only 11 years old, when she and
                her mother would routinely travel to Nashville to pich demo tapes of karaoke covers. She was repeatedly
                rejected until she was 14, when her parents moved their family from Pennsylvania to Nashville, and
                Taylor signed with Sony/Big Machine Records to work on her debut album. She was one of the very first
                artists to sign with Big Machine Records, a new label run by Scott Borchetta, a man who Taylor
                considered a father figure, who eventually betrayed her and sold her catalogue in 2016.

            <p><i>Taylor Swift</i> was surprisingly successful, despite many label execs being worried about Taylor's
                inability to appeal to a middle aged male audience, country musics largest audience at the time. Some
                critics said that she filled the "Dixie Chicks gap" after they were cancelled in 2003.

            <p>"Our Song", released as the third single from debut, was Taylor's first Hot Country #1, followed closely
                by "Should've Said No" which became her second #1.

            <p>"Tim McGraw", the first track and first single, holds an irony that 16 year old Taylor could not have
                predicted. She sings: <i>When you think Tim Mcgraw, I hope you think of me</i> and <i>Someday you'll
                    turn your radio on/I hope it takes you back to that place</i> Poor high school fling Brandon doesn't
                need to hear a Tim Mcgraw song at all to be reminded of Taylor, as she herself is on the radio far more
                often at this point.

            <p><i>Taylor Swift</i>, though likely Taylor's most forgotten, least fan-favorite album, set her up for
                success early. This album was able to pull in a new demographic to country music, "teeny-boppers", or
                young teenage girls who didn't previously listen to country music. These fans, loyal and dedicated, have
                followed and grown with Taylor throughout the years.
